<!--HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. 
    Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.
    Your JS file must contain a 'use strict' declaration at the top. Always.

    Design a guessing game about you that involves FIVE yes/no questions. 

    The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.

    Useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.

    Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have.

    Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.

    
     1. I have always been a very humble person, remembering where I came from and what I have endured.  Do you think I have always had a roof over my head? 
     2. I was raised in an unconventional environment with unique experiences that have enhanced my intuitive capabilities and perspective scope.  Was there a father present in my life?
     3. My educational goals and path in life were guided by fears of failure.  Do I value passion in my life?
     4. I spent 7 years of my life in the Middle East. Did I serve in the military?
     5. Life has a funny way of making us a victim of circumstnces on which our path through life is dictated.
